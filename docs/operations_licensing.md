## Frequently Asked Questions

??? question "Can I try before I buy?"

    Yes. Start with the AGPL-3.0 version for evaluation and development. When ready for production deployment in proprietary applications, upgrade to the commercial license through AWS Marketplace.

    The commercial license also includes a 14-day free trial, allowing you to test the full capabilities in your production environment risk-free.

    This allows you to validate stdapi.ai's capabilities before committing to a commercial license.

??? question "Do I need a commercial license for internal tools?"

    Most likely, yes. The AGPL-3.0 license requires source code disclosure even for software accessed over a network (like internal APIs and tools).

    If you're building internal applications that your team or organization accesses over a network, a commercial license removes these obligations and lets you keep your code private.

??? question "What if my project is already AGPL-compliant?"

    If you're comfortable open-sourcing your entire application under AGPL-3.0, the free version is all you need.

    The commercial license is for organizations that need to keep their code proprietary or integrate stdapi.ai into commercial products.

??? question "Can I switch from AGPL to commercial later?"

    Yes. Many customers start with the AGPL version during development and testing, then switch to the commercial license when deploying to production.

    Your product code activates commercial licensing automatically - no migration or technical changes required.

??? question "What's included in the AWS Marketplace Standard Contract?"

    The [AWS Marketplace Standard Contract (SCMP)](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/terms) provides:

    - Clear license grant terms for commercial use
    - Standard warranty and liability provisions
    - Straightforward payment and billing terms
    - Professional indemnification terms

    It's the same trusted contract used across thousands of enterprise software products on AWS Marketplace.
